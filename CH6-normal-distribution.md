# The normal distribution
__objectives__
```
identify distribution as symmetric or skewed
identify the properties of a normal distribution
find the area under standard normal distribution, by giving various z value
find the probabilities for a normal distributed variable by transforming it into a standard normal value
use the central limit theorem to solve problems
use the approximation to compute prob. for binomial variables

```
## Normal distributions
The math function of normal distribution:
- $y = \frac{e^{-(X-\mu)^2/2\sigma^2}}{\sigma \sqrt2\pi}$
- where
  - $e \sim 2.718$
  - $\pi \sim 3.14$
  - $\mu$ = population mean
  - $\sigma$ = population standard deviation

- But in statistics, tables or technology is used for specific problem. 
__normal distribution properties__
```
1. bell-shaped
2. the mean, median, and mode are equal, and located at the center of the distribution
3.A normal distribution curve is unimodal (it has only one mode)
4. The curve is symmetric about the mean, which is equalvalent to saying that its shape is the same on both sides of a vertical line, there are no gaps or hole.
5. The curve is continuous; that there is no hole or gaps
6. The curve never touches the x axis but it gets closer
7. The total area under a normal distribution is equal to 1.00 or 100%
8. The area under the part of normal curve that lies within 1 standard deviation of the mean is appox. 0.68 or 68%, within 2 standard diviations, about 0.95, and within 3 standard diviation, about 0.997 or 997%.
```
### The standard Normal Distribution
- The standard normal distribution is a normal distribution with a mean of $0$ and standard diviation of $1$.
