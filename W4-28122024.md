## Probability distribution & Normality Data
### Expected value
- $Exp(x) = np$
  - $Exp(x)$: expected value
  - $n$
  - $p$: successful prob. of the experiment
 
__Where can we find $p$?__
- Classical approach
- Relative frequency approach
- Subjective approach

### Normal Distribution
- Normal curve
  - Normal distribution (mean, mode, and median are the same)
  - Left-skewed (mean, mode, median)
  - Right-skewed (median, mode, mean)




## Notes
- poisson distribution is the dependent
